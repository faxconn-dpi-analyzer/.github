<h1>DPI Analyzer - Overview</h1>

<h2>Purpose of the program</h2>
<p><strong>DPI Analyzer</strong> is a Windows software designed to help users measure, analyze, and optimize their mouse DPI (dots per inch) and sensitivity settings. It is widely used by gamers, designers, and anyone who requires precise cursor control for performance-critical tasks. The software provides accurate measurement tools to evaluate the real DPI of your mouse and adjust sensitivity for consistent movement.</p>

<h2>Main Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Measure real mouse DPI to ensure accurate cursor movement.</li>
  <li>Analyze mouse sensitivity settings and adjust for gaming or productivity tasks.</li>
  <li>Visual representation of mouse movement across different DPI settings.</li>
  <li>Export or save DPI measurements for comparison or documentation.</li>
  <li>Lightweight Windows application with minimal system requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unique Features</h2>
<p>DPI Analyzer offers precise real-time calculation of mouse DPI, allowing users to detect discrepancies between advertised DPI and actual performance. It also provides a user-friendly interface for testing sensitivity with different resolutions and setups.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The software is intended for gamers seeking optimal mouse control, designers and digital artists who require precise pointer accuracy, and enthusiasts who wish to calibrate or compare mouse performance across devices.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Using DPI Analyzer</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ensures accurate DPI and sensitivity calibration.</li>
  <li>Lightweight and easy to use, no complex installation.</li>
  <li>Helps achieve consistent mouse behavior across applications and games.</li>
  <li>Useful for comparing different mouse models or settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functional Modules</h2>
<p>DPI Analyzer provides modules for measuring raw DPI, visualizing movement distances, testing sensitivity across resolutions, and exporting results. It supports quick comparison of multiple mouse settings to determine the optimal configuration for user needs.</p>

<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Windows 7 or later (Windows 10/11 supported)</li>
  <li>Minimal disk space and memory usage</li>
  <li>No special hardware required beyond a standard mouse</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>
<p>Windows desktops and laptops (Windows 7, 8, 10, 11).</p>

<h2>Algorithms and Mechanisms</h2>
<p>DPI Analyzer calculates actual mouse DPI by comparing physical cursor movement on screen to the input data from the device. It can detect deviations between claimed and actual DPI and provides sensitivity adjustment recommendations.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>The program runs with minimal CPU and memory overhead and provides results instantly for quick calibration sessions.</p>

<h2>Installation and Setup</h2>
<p>Download the executable from the official source, run the installer, and launch DPI Analyzer. The software opens with a simple interface where users can select their resolution and begin DPI measurement immediately.</p>

<h2>Usage Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Install and open DPI Analyzer.</li>
  <li>Select screen resolution and mouse profile.</li>
  <li>Move the mouse as instructed for calibration measurement.</li>
  <li>Analyze displayed DPI and sensitivity data.</li>
  <li>Adjust mouse settings accordingly for optimal performance.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Reviews and Feedback</h2>
<p>DPI Analyzer is positively reviewed by gaming and professional communities for its simplicity and accuracy. Users appreciate its ability to quickly detect real DPI and help achieve consistent control.</p>

<h2>Licensing and Terms</h2>
<p>DPI Analyzer is typically distributed as freeware for personal use. Users should check official sources for licensing updates or restrictions.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>DPI Analyzer is focused solely on measuring and analyzing DPI and sensitivity. It does not provide additional mouse customization, macros, or driver features.</p>

<h2>Typical Scenarios</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Gamers calibrating mouse DPI for FPS or strategy games.</li>
  <li>Digital artists adjusting sensitivity for precise drawing or design.</li>
  <li>Comparing performance between multiple mice to select the best device.</li>
  <li>Optimizing cursor speed for high-resolution displays.</li>
</ul>
